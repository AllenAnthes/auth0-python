#Auth0 + Python WebApp Seed
This is the seed project you need to use if you're going to create a Regular WebApp with Python. If you want to build a Python API that will be used with a SPA or a Mobile device, please check this [other seed project](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-python/tree/master/examples/flask-api)

#Running the example
In order to run the example you need to have `python` and `pip` installed.

You also need to set the ClientSecret, ClientId, Domain and CallbackURL for your Auth0 app as enviroment variables with the following names respectively: AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET, AUTH0_CLIENT_ID, AUTH0_DOMAIN and AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL.

For that, if you just create a file named .env in the directory and set the values like the following, the app will just work:

````bash
# .env file
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=myCoolSecret
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=myCoolClientId
AUTH0_DOMAIN=samples.auth0.com
AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/auth/auth0/callback
````
Once you've set those 4 enviroment variables, just run `python server.py` and try calling [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, amont others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [Json Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
